Task: Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

**Q.1: Identify FRs and NFRs**

**Functional Requirements:** Some of the Functional Requirements are listed below

1. There should be a login/sign-in portal for member students who want issue or return books.
2. System should allow any user (member or non-member) to search and browse the books.
3. Database of LIS needs to be backed up at regular intervals so that, during any event of failure, user and book data would still be available. The database should also be safegaurding the confidential information of LIS members.
4. There should be filters and options available for different genres, to ease the task of searching books.
5. Members users should be given the privilege of extending their borrowing period, if they have issued a book.
6. There should be a facility of admin access/login for libararian and other working staff of library, so that they can keep track of transactions happening in the system and can also insert, delete or update records of books.
7. Some of the tasks such as removing a book from the list if has reached its maximum borrowing capacity, notifying users through messages if their returning date is about to come, should be automated.

**Non-Functional Requirements:** Some of the Non-Functional Requirements are listed below:

1. Concurrency: The system should be equipped with the capacity to handle large number of users at the same time.
2. Security: The LIS should only be accessible by users who are connected to the LAN network of the Institute, for security reasons and making the system less vulnerable.
3. Confidentiality: The passwords or confidential data should be stored in an encrypted format in the database, to avoid leaking of data in case of a data breach.
4. Maintainability : The site is easy to maintain and to update things.
5. Flexibility: The system must be accessible from all devices like mobile, laptops, computers, etc through a website or portal. It should be compatible with all browsers like brave, chrome, firefox, opera etc.
6. System should send an alert to users through message before going down during specific hours.
7. It should be user-friendly.

**Q.2.**

**Scope:**

Our project's target audience consists of those with significant hearing loss. They will be able to identify important sound events using this application that call for an immediate alert or ongoing logging. The project consists of a smartphone software that identifies significant sound events employing artificial intelligence. Neural networks with sound recognition training should be part of artificial intelligence. Our target audience uses mobile applications in daily life to make crucial decisions in real time, thus they must be quick and extremely accurate.

**Features:**

1. The app should alert users when it hears the sounds of an emergency.
2. Continual Logging is critical for the user.
3. Applications should be quick to respond and have low latency.
4. When a critical emergency is recognised and there is no reaction from the user, notify the person/relative which is specified by user.
5. Because it is a mobile application, it should be compatible with any OS.

**Non-functional aspects:**

1. Security of the user's personal and log data/history.
2. Users should remain logged in at all times to prevent problems when they are not in urgent situations.
3. In an emergency, users should be able to utilise the app to send the person they've designated their current location to.
4. The password of user must be saved in database with encryption.
5. The app should be accessible to the intended audience 24x7. 
6. The target market should be able to access the app around-the-clock on any app store.
